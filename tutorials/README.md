# twist-toast Tutorial Series

A comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building a production-ready React toast notification library from scratch.

## Overview

This tutorial series teaches you how to build twist-toast, a React toast notification library that gives developers full design control while managing all the complex behavior. You'll learn advanced TypeScript patterns, React library development, state management, testing strategies, and more.

## What Makes This Different?

Unlike most toast libraries that provide pre-built UI components, twist-toast inverts the relationship: **you own the components, we manage the behavior**. This architectural decision drives everything we build and teaches valuable patterns applicable to any React library.
